### **Exercise: Drawing the CI/CD Pipeline for a Banking App's Account Opening Process**

Create a diagram of a CI/CD pipeline for a banking application that allows customers to open new accounts. Illustrate how code changes move from development to production while ensuring security, compliance, and reliability at each stage. This exercise will help you understand and visualize the key steps involved in securely and efficiently deploying updates to this critical system.

#### **Instructions**

1. **Understand the Application Context**:
   - You are part of a development team responsible for a banking app feature that enables users to open new bank accounts online. Given the sensitive nature of financial data and strict regulatory requirements, the deployment process must be stable, secure, and compliant.

2. **Identify the Main Stages of the Deployment Pipeline**

3. **Draw the Pipeline Diagram**

4. **Populate the stages with details and tools, for example**:
    - Git
    - GitHub
    - Jenkins
    - TeamCity
    - Azure DevOps
    - JUnit
    - Selenium
    - Postman
    - SonarQube
    - Snyk
    - Ansible
    - Kubernetes
    - Docker
    - AWS ECS
    - Dynatrace

6. **Highlight Key Processes and Controls**
   - **Manual Approval Gates**
   - **Continuous Feedback Loop**
