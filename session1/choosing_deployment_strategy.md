### Exercise: Choosing the Right Deployment Strategy

In this exercise, you will evaluate different deployment strategies based on concrete real-world scenarios. You will choose the most appropriate strategy for each scenario and explain your reasoning. The strategies to choose from are:

- **Blue-Green Deployment**
- **Canary Release**
- **Rolling Update**
- **Feature Toggles**

For each scenario, read the description and answer the following questions. Your goal is to decide which deployment strategy fits best and provide reasoning for your choice. This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of deployment strategies and their use cases.

### **Scenario 1: Launching a New Feature for an E-Commerce Platform**

The e-commerce platform is about to launch a **new payment gateway**. This is a critical feature that, if it fails, could prevent users from completing transactions. The team wants to minimize risk and avoid downtime during the deployment. The feature is fully tested in a staging environment, and it will be available for all customers once deployed.

**Questions:**
1. What are the main risks associated with deploying a critical feature like this one to all users at once?
2. Which deployment strategy would you use to ensure that users experience minimal downtime while minimizing the impact of any potential issues with the new payment gateway?
3. How does the chosen deployment strategy help mitigate risks, and what specific steps should be taken to implement it?
4. If you had to roll back this feature quickly, how would you approach it using your chosen strategy?

### **Scenario 2: Deploying an Update to a Web Application with New UI Changes**

Your team has developed a **new user interface (UI)** for a web application that has been live for a while. This UI introduces significant changes to the navigation and visual design. The change is intended to improve the user experience but could have unintended effects on user behavior or usability. A significant number of users have already adapted to the old UI.

**Questions:**
1. What factors should be considered when deciding how to release UI changes, given that users might be accustomed to the old interface?
2. Which deployment strategy would allow you to release the new UI to a small subset of users first and gradually roll it out to the rest of the users while monitoring feedback?
3. What actions should you take to monitor the user experience and gather feedback during the rollout?
4. If users face significant issues with the new UI, what steps would you take to revert to the old interface quickly using the chosen strategy?

### **Scenario 3: Fixing a Critical Security Vulnerability in a Production System**

A **critical security vulnerability** has been identified in a widely used feature of your application that needs to be fixed immediately. The vulnerability affects a large number of users, and if not addressed quickly, it could lead to significant breaches of sensitive data. You need to deploy the fix to production with minimal downtime while ensuring that the system is still functional during the update.

**Questions:**
1. What are the risks involved in deploying security fixes to a large, live system where downtime should be minimized?
2. Which deployment strategy would allow you to deploy the security patch in a way that ensures continuous availability while minimizing the risk of causing disruptions?
3. How would you verify the success of the deployment and ensure the fix is applied without causing new issues?
4. How does the chosen strategy enable you to minimize downtime and ensure system stability during the deployment?

### **Scenario 4: Launching a New Feature Flag to Control User Access**

You are deploying a **new feature flag** for a **recommendation engine** that will be rolled out gradually to users. The feature will display personalized product recommendations on the homepage based on users' browsing history. However, you want to test it in production with a small subset of users first, and then gradually expand it to more users. This way, you can enable or disable the feature without needing to deploy new code.

**Questions:**
1. How does using a feature flag in this scenario provide flexibility in deployment?
2. Which deployment strategy allows you to enable the feature gradually for different segments of users, with the ability to toggle it on or off for different user groups without requiring a full redeployment?
3. How will you monitor the feature's performance and make adjustments based on user feedback?
4. If you encounter issues with the recommendation engine, how would you roll back the feature quickly using the chosen strategy?

### **Scenario 5: Updating a Backend Service with a Non-Critical Performance Enhancement**

You need to deploy a **performance enhancement** to a backend service that handles user requests. The change is non-critical but aims to improve the response time of the service. It should not impact users directly, but there is a possibility of minor disruptions in performance. The update is not urgent, but you want to deploy it in a way that allows you to monitor its impact on production systems.

**Questions:**
1. What considerations should you keep in mind when deploying a non-critical change that could affect the backend service?
2. Which deployment strategy would you use to incrementally roll out the update without causing disruptions, while still allowing you to monitor its impact on the system?
3. How will you determine whether the performance enhancement is successful and ensure it doesnâ€™t introduce any new issues?
4. If performance issues arise after the update, how would you roll back the change using the chosen strategy?

### **Scenario 6: A Major Feature Update with Multiple Dependencies**

Your team is preparing to release a **major feature update** to your platform. This update introduces a set of changes across multiple services, including new APIs and updates to existing business logic. The new feature relies on several other services and infrastructure updates. The deployment will require thorough testing, and the feature should be carefully controlled to ensure that all parts of the platform work together correctly.

**Questions:**
1. Given the complexity and number of dependencies involved in this deployment, what are the key risks you must manage during the rollout?
2. Which deployment strategy would be best for ensuring that different services and dependencies are updated in a controlled way, with minimal risk of failures affecting users?
3. How will you ensure that the new feature is only made available to a small set of users initially while ensuring the dependencies are functioning correctly?
4. If there are issues with one of the services or dependencies, how would you approach rolling back or modifying the deployment quickly?
