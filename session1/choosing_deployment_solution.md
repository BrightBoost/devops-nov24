### **Scenario 1: Launching a New Feature for an E-Commerce Platform**
- **Most fitting choice:** **Blue-Green Deployment**
    - **Why?** This strategy minimizes risk by having two separate environments: one for the existing version and one for the new feature. You can switch traffic to the new version after verifying its stability, which is crucial for a critical payment gateway feature.
  
- **Canary Release** could also be a valid choice, especially if the feature is small enough to be tested with a small subset of users, but **Blue-Green Deployment** is typically more effective for high-risk, production-critical features.

### **Scenario 2: Deploying an Update to a Web Application with New UI Changes**
- **Most fitting choice:** **Canary Release**
    - **Why?** The UI changes will impact user experience significantly, and you want to ensure that the new UI is well-received before deploying it to all users. A **Canary Release** allows you to release the new UI to a small set of users, monitor feedback, and gradually roll it out.
  
- **Rolling Update** could work, but since UI changes can be disruptive, starting small with a **Canary Release** gives you more control.

### **Scenario 3: Fixing a Critical Security Vulnerability in a Production System**
- **Most fitting choice:** **Rolling Update**
    - **Why?** For security fixes, you need to ensure that the deployment happens quickly without downtime. **Rolling Updates** allow you to deploy the fix in stages, minimizing downtime while maintaining system availability.

- **Blue-Green Deployment** could be another option but might be less practical in cases where you need to fix a vulnerability quickly on the existing infrastructure without the luxury of switching to a completely separate environment.

### **Scenario 4: Launching a New Feature Flag to Control User Access**
- **Most fitting choice:** **Feature Toggles**
    - **Why?** Feature flags are specifically designed for **gradual feature rollout** and can be toggled on or off without requiring redeployment. This makes them ideal for situations where you want to experiment or control access to new features without interrupting users or infrastructure.

- **Canary Release** could also be useful here, especially if you want to limit access to a small group of users initially, but **Feature Toggles** are more flexible and dynamic for controlling access during the lifecycle of a feature.

---

### **Scenario 5: Updating a Backend Service with a Non-Critical Performance Enhancement**
- **Most fitting choice:** **Rolling Update**
    - **Why?** Since the change is non-critical, a **Rolling Update** is ideal as it allows you to deploy the update gradually across the backend service, ensuring continuous availability while you monitor performance.

- **Canary Release** could also be applicable, especially if you want to release the update to a small subset of users first, but **Rolling Update** is more practical for backend performance changes.

---

### **Scenario 6: A Major Feature Update with Multiple Dependencies**
- **Most fitting choice:** **Blue-Green Deployment**
    - **Why?** For a major update with dependencies across multiple services, **Blue-Green Deployment** provides a safer approach. You can have a fully tested "green" environment running the new feature and switch traffic once you are confident in its stability.

- **Canary Release** might be applicable if you want to gradually test the feature across different services, but **Blue-Green Deployment** provides more control and isolation for complex changes with interdependencies.
