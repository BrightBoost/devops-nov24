### Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository
Start by cloning the demo Node.js application repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrightBoost/demo-node-app
```

### Step 2: Open in VS Code
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder in your terminal. Then, open it in Visual Studio Code by running:
```bash
cd demo-node-app
code .
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Before running the application, you need to install its dependencies. Run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Application
Now, try starting the application with:
```bash
npm start
```
However, this step will fail because of a missing `.env` file.

### Step 5: Solve the Error
Youâ€™ll see an error similar to this:
```
node: .env: not found
```
To fix this, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. You can do this by creating a new file named `.env` in your VS Code editor or by running:
```bash
touch .env
```
Then, open the `.env` file and add the following line to specify the port the application should run on:
```
PORT=8080
```
Save the file.

### Step 6: Re-run the Application
Now, run the application again:
```bash
npm start
```
The application should now start without any errors.

### Step 7: Find Your IPv4 Address
To access the application from a browser, you need to find your local machine's IP address. In the terminal, run the following command:
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for the `IPv4 Address` under your network adapter's details. 

### Step 8: Open the Application in Your Browser
Now, open your browser and go to the following URL, replacing `<ipaddress>` with your actual IPv4 address:
```
http://<ipaddress>:PORT
```
